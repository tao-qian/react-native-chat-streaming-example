# OpenAI Chat with Streaming in React Native

<img src="./demo.gif" width="200" alt="Demo">

This is a minimal example for a chat app with streaming support in React Native, using [react-native-gifted-chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) and [react-native-sse](https://github.com/binaryminds/react-native-sse).

The alternative approach for streaming is fetch with Polyfill: https://github.com/expo/expo/discussions/21710.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Update .env file with your OpenAI API key.
3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
